If you want to contribute to someone else's project, how would you do?
    If Nabin wants to contribute to Nila's project, then nabin can open up his github account and search for nila's repo, OR,
    Get repo's link from nila and use it to open up the project. In order to fork, either click on the fork option or click on 
    "create a new file" - it will fork a project on nabin's repo. Or if click on the fork option, it will give you a project.
    Once you type on a file what you wanna contribute, click on "commit a new file." This creates file, but where?
    To know, click on "Create a pull request" so that a request is automatically send from contributor to recipent.
    For recipent to get that file, recipent has to click on "Pull requests." If everky thing is good on the file from contributro
    hit on "Merge on pull request" option and follow the prompts. You can also comment back to contributor if you want.
